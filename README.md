# A "Fresh" Filter
An item filter for the game [Path of Exile](https://www.pathofexile.com/).

## Overview

I put this filter together because I didn't really care for the extensive visual rules that many filters use to illustrate item properties. I just want to know if I care to pick an item up, and I want items to be visually distinct. So I tried to generally limit my rules and use a palette of five colors only.

### Standard Filter
The initial filter I made. Shows a reasonable number of items, with more focus on influened items and the "best" bases otherwise.

### Soft Filter
This version of the filter shows a lot of rares. I use this when starting a league, and often in SSF.

### Level Filter
A leveling filter that limits equipment drops to near-level ranges.

### Hard Filter
This version of the filter tries to limit equipment more, as well as hiding some of the lower value currencies.
