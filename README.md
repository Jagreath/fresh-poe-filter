# A "Fresh" Filter
An item filter for the game [Path of Exile](https://www.pathofexile.com/).

## Overview

I made this filter because I (personally) found a lot of filters do a bit *too* much. I just want to know if an item should be picked up. 

So I tried to generally limit my rules and use a palette of five colors only.

### The Base Filter
The initial filter I made. Shows a reasonable number of items, with more focus on influenced items and the "best" bases otherwise.

### Soft Filter
This version of the filter shows a lot of rares. I use this when starting a league, and often in SSF.

### Level Filter
A leveling filter that limits equipment drops to (mostly) near-level ranges.

### Hard Filter
A more restrictive version of the base filter.
