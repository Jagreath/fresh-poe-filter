# Jagreath's "Fresh" Filter
A filter for the game [Path of Exile](https://www.pathofexile.com/). For the uninitiated: Path of Exile is an ARPG, and filter files are used as a way of limiting what item drops are shown, and how they are shown.

## Overview
The goal of this filter was to allow me to spend less time thinking about the item drops displayed on screen, and more time actually playing.

It attempts to do this by having a limited palette, a restrictive set of rules on what item drops are actually shown, and fewer rules for item drops that *are* shown.

### Soft Filter
A version of the filter that will generally show more rare item drops.

### Level Filter
A version of the filter that ignores endgame item drops, and has graduated rules for weapons and flasks that help during leveling.
